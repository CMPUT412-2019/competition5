# Competition 5

This repository contains our code for the fifth competition of [CMPUT 412, Experimental Mobile Robotics](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/undergraduate-studies/course-directory/courses/experimental-mobile-robotics).
The challenges in this competition are identical to the previous competition, [competition 4](https://github.com/CMPUT412-2019/competition4), our solution to which builds on our solutions to competitions [3](https://github.com/cmput412-2019/competition3) and [2](https://github.com/cmput412-2019/cmput412-competition2).

As [described previously](https://github.com/CMPUT412-2019/competition4#purpose), the competition consists of a course on which the robot must demonstrate various tasks, such as line following, shape detection, and AR tag detection.
This competition differs only in the scoring: multiple runs around the track are allowed, and points are cumulative in all runs.
The point amounts are also re-balanced to favour box-pushing.
For details on the individual tasks, see [our previous report](https://github.com/CMPUT412-2019/competition4#competition-overview).
